Medical robots in surgery could provide a potential improvement to the efficiency and precision of current surgery. Surgical robotics can be broadly sub divided into two groups robotically assisted surgery and autonomous surgical robots. Robotic enhancement is where the surgeon is in direct control of the operation and the robot is designed to increase accuracy or efficiency, such as the Da Vinci (Intuitive Surgical Inc. CA) which is one of the most commonly used surgical systems in the world (2). Autonomous systems can be defined as being designed to carry out partial or full surgical operations without direct human input, while these are mainly at the experimental level they could have a wide range of applications in the future. However, there are several ethical considerations relevant to the development and deployment of surgical robotics including: how are the robots tested and developed; how are they safely introduced; who is responsible if something goes wrong; how can the financial cost of robots be justified on an outcome basis.</p>\n<p>It is important for an engineer developing new surgical robotics to embed ethics into the research project to justify the purpose and benefit of the project. Central to the design process should be the people who are affected by the development, namely the patients and medical professionals, therefore a key challenge is the direct collaboration with these parties to establish a clear need and benefit. To ensure that ethical concerns are a primary focus of any development scheme rather than merely considered after development a possible frame work for responsible research and innovation was described by Stahl and Coeckelbergh in the acronym AREA (3).\n•\t“Anticipate — describing and analysing the impacts that might arise.\n•\tReflect — reflecting on the purposes of, motivations for and potential implications of the research.\n•\tEngage — opening up such visions, impacts and questioning to broader deliberation, dialogue, engagement.\n•\tAct — using these processes to influence the direction and trajectory of the research and innovation process itself.”\nIt is a doctor’s duty to “first, do no harm” (4) , therefore in order for a surgeon to use a medical robot to assist with or perform surgery there must be complete assurance that it is in the best interest of the patient. It is the role of the engineer to insure comprehensive and rigorous testing. An ethical challenge is how are surgical robots tested, and at what point does it become acceptable to deploy robots on an actual human?  Guide lines set by governing bodies, although meant to ensure suitable ethical standards, vary in quality and cannot always be a true indication of safety of a new product. Flaws in the process have been highlighted in the past with high profile cases such as fruit netting almost gaining Conformité Européenne (CE) accreditation as a surgical implant, which could be sold across EU (5). Clearly Surgical robotics are far more complex and so have more thorough legislation, for example requiring clinical evidence to gain US food and administration (FDA) (6) and European medicines agency (EMA) (7) approval, however there is still a range of ways of meeting this requirement from the gold standard of randomised controlled trials to cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports and animal research studies (8). An ethical problem for the engineer and company is the ceiling of evidence required when costs have to be considered. </p>\n<p>For successful implementation of surgical robotics into routine care engineers must consider ways of providing training and assessing competencies, this responsibility is shared with health care institutions, but remains an ethical challenge for the engineer in development. The importance of this was highlighted in a recent coroner’s case in November 2018 in which a 69-year-old man died following cardiac surgery carried out using a Da Vinci robot. Contributory factors were identified to be the surgeon’s lack of training and familiarity with the robot and the lack of due oversight (9). Therefore, engineers must integrate into the design considerations of how best to make robots intuitive to use and develop adequate training simulations to ensure the operator has the appropriate skills, this would require close communication with medical professionals. It is also necessary to develop a feed-back loop of adverse event reporting that includes analysis of the technical data so that engineers can modify and adapt future designs to avoid or reduce the risk of similar failings. However, this raises another ethical issue of data privacy, and how and what data should be released, with potential conflicts of reputational and commercial interests between manufactures and health care providers. </p>\n<p>Autonomous surgical robots pose additional ethical challenges; increased autonomy in any area always has implications for the workforce with the potential to reduce job numbers and for skills to be lost, and so it is paramount that there is a clear benefit provided. In health care in England the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) uses Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (10) as a metric to compare the value/cost of different interventions. Therefore, for wide scale implementation in the UK the engineer would have to carefully consider not only the need and safety of the robot but affordability leading to the ethical challenge of where the balance lies for a private profit driven company. Culpability in the event of a surgical complication for autonomous robots raises many ethical issues with legal litigation extending to not only medical professionals and institutes but also manufacturers (11). By restricting the target population group (e.g. patients with specific anatomical features) the manufacture will standardise some patient factors, reducing the likely hood of technical errors. However, is it ethical to restrict the use of a new technology, especially if it is proven to be beneficial, merely to reduce litigation.    </p>\n<p>Surgical robots are rapidly being developed and becoming a reality, engineers need to be cognisant of the potential ethical issues and ensure they are considered as an integral part of the design and development process. The application of robotics to medicine and more specifically surgery is a highly sensitive area with no margin for error with the patient’s well-being always being the highest priority. Engineers must clearly define the purpose and role of robotics, which can only be achieved through close collaboration with medical professionals.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Surgeons RC of.
