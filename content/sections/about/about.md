I am a 3rd year undergraduate studying engineering at the Univeristy of Cambridge on a four year intergrated masters course. After two years studying general engineering covering all the major disciplines I chose modules to specailise in Information and Bioengineering.

Outside of studying I love tennis, badminton, road biking and photography. I am college captain for the badminton and play tennis for both the university and college. Its one of life's great pleasure to be out on court on a sunny day.

I am particualry intrested in robotics and software. Here are a few of the technologies I have worked with.
